## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **npm provenance** — packages are now published with OIDC trusted publishing for verifiable supply chain security

### Fixed
- **Instagram API base URL** — use `graph.instagram.com` for Instagram endpoints; tokens from Instagram Login flow (`IGAA...`) were rejected by `graph.facebook.com`
- **Meta platform endpoints** — separate `FB_BASE` (`graph.facebook.com`) for token exchange, debug, and webhook tools that only exist on the Facebook Graph API
- **POST request encoding** — switch from `application/json` to `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` for POST requests; optional parameters like `topic_tag` and `poll` were silently ignored by the Meta API with JSON encoding
