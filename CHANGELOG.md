## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Cross-share Threads posts to Instagram Stories** — all four publish tools (`threads_publish_text`, `threads_publish_image`, `threads_publish_video`, `threads_publish_carousel`) now accept optional `share_to_ig_story` parameter (`"light"`/`"dark"`) to cross-share the post to the user's linked Instagram account as a Story; requires `threads_share_to_instagram` permission; the Threads post publishes normally even if cross-share fails; response includes `crossreshare_to_ig_status` (`"SUCCESS"` or `"FAILED"`)

## [3.5.0] — 2026-04-05

### Fixed
- **`threads_publish_carousel` fails — carousel container not polled before publish** — added missing `waitForThreadsContainer()` call for the carousel container between creation and publish; without it the Meta API returned error 24 / subcode 4279009 ("Cannot find media with the given ID") when the carousel container was still processing ([#142](https://github.com/exileum/meta-mcp/issues/142))
- **`threads_get_container_status` fails on published post IDs with confusing error** — updated tool description to clarify it only works with unpublished container IDs; added error handling that detects the "nonexisting field" API error and returns a helpful message explaining the limitation ([#143](https://github.com/exileum/meta-mcp/issues/143))
- **`threads_search_posts` uses wrong endpoint and parameters** — changed endpoint from `/{user_id}/threads_search` (nonexistent) to `/keyword_search`; split `search_type` into `search_type` (`TOP`/`RECENT`) for ordering and `search_mode` (`KEYWORD`/`TAG`) for search behavior; removed unsupported `CAROUSEL` from `media_type` enum; per the [Threads Keyword Search docs](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threads/keyword-search) ([#141](https://github.com/exileum/meta-mcp/issues/141))
- **`threads_get_post_insights` uses invalid metric `clicks` for post-level insights** — removed `clicks` from the default metrics for `threads_get_post_insights`; `clicks` is only valid for user-level insights (`threads_get_user_insights`), not for individual post insights per the Threads Insights API docs ([#140](https://github.com/exileum/meta-mcp/issues/140))
- **`threads_get_post` and `threads_get_posts` request non-existent field `gif_attachment`** — replaced `gif_attachment` with `gif_url` in the default `fields` parameter for both tools; `gif_attachment` is a write-only parameter used when creating posts, while `gif_url` is the correct readable field per the Threads Media API docs ([#139](https://github.com/exileum/meta-mcp/issues/139))
- **`ig_publish_carousel` calls `media_publish` before carousel container finishes processing** — added missing `waitForContainer()` call for the carousel container, matching the pattern used in all other Instagram publish tools; without it the Meta API returned error 9007 / subcode 2207027 ("Media ID is not available") when the container was still `IN_PROGRESS` ([#138](https://github.com/exileum/meta-mcp/issues/138))
- **`topic_tag` silently accepted invalid characters in Threads publish tools** — added Zod `regex` validation rejecting periods (`.`) and ampersands (`&`) per Meta API docs; added comprehensive tests verifying `topic_tag` is correctly forwarded in all four Threads publish tools (text, image, video, carousel) and form-encoded correctly by MetaClient ([#137](https://github.com/exileum/meta-mcp/issues/137))
- **`ig_delete_media` references wrong permission name** — reverted from `instagram_business_content_publish` (a publishing permission, incorrectly set in PR #129) back to the correct `instagram_manage_contents`; added note that the DELETE endpoint is only available via Facebook Login, not Instagram Login, per the [IG Media API reference](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-platform/reference/instagram-media/) ([#122](https://github.com/exileum/meta-mcp/issues/122))

## [3.4.0] — 2026-04-05

### Fixed
- **`waitForContainer` / `waitForThreadsContainer` ignore EXPIRED and unexpected statuses** — both container polling functions now handle `EXPIRED`, `PUBLISHED`, and unknown statuses immediately instead of silently polling until timeout; timeout error message now includes the last observed status ([#28](https://github.com/exileum/meta-mcp/issues/28))
- **`ig_publish_story` missing `media_type: 'STORIES'`** — image stories had no `media_type` (defaulting to feed post) and video stories incorrectly used `"VIDEO"` instead of `"STORIES"`; now both set `media_type: "STORIES"` as required by Meta's Content Publishing API ([#50](https://github.com/exileum/meta-mcp/issues/50))
- **`threads_get_user_insights` missing required `period` parameter** — added `period` parameter (day/lifetime) to the tool schema and API request; without it the Meta API returned error `(#100) The period param is required for this metric` for all time-series metrics ([#30](https://github.com/exileum/meta-mcp/issues/30))
- **`ig_send_message` sends double-encoded body incompatible with Meta API** — switched from URL-encoded form body with `JSON.stringify()`-ed values to a proper `application/json` request body, matching what Meta's Instagram Messaging API expects; added `json` option to `MetaClient.request()` for endpoints requiring JSON bodies ([#31](https://github.com/exileum/meta-mcp/issues/31))
- **`thumb_offset: 0` silently ignored in `ig_publish_video` and `ig_publish_reel`** — falsy check `if (thumb_offset)` skipped valid value `0`; replaced with `if (thumb_offset !== undefined)`. Same fix applied to all numeric `limit` parameters across Instagram and Threads tools ([#32](https://github.com/exileum/meta-mcp/issues/32))
- **`threads_publish_image` skips container status polling before publishing** — added missing `waitForThreadsContainer()` call so image containers are polled for `FINISHED` status before publishing, matching the behavior of `threads_publish_video` and `threads_publish_carousel` and preventing intermittent publish failures for large images ([#29](https://github.com/exileum/meta-mcp/issues/29))
- **Tenor GIF provider already sunset** — removed `TENOR` from `gif_provider` enum in `threads_publish_text` since Tenor API support was sunset by Meta on March 31, 2026; only GIPHY is currently supported ([#43](https://github.com/exileum/meta-mcp/issues/43))
- **Instagram messaging tool descriptions reference wrong permission** — updated `ig_get_conversations` and `ig_send_message` descriptions to reference `instagram_business_manage_messages` (correct for Instagram API with Instagram Login) instead of the deprecated `instagram_manage_messages` (Messenger Platform) ([#23](https://github.com/exileum/meta-mcp/issues/23))

### Changed
- **Instagram setup instructions updated for Instagram API with Instagram Login** — README now documents the modern setup flow (no Facebook Page required, dashboard token generation, `instagram_business_*` permissions) instead of the legacy Instagram Graph API flow ([#23](https://github.com/exileum/meta-mcp/issues/23))

## [3.3.1] — 2026-04-05

### Added
- **Publish to GitHub Packages** — the release workflow now publishes to the GitHub Packages npm registry (`npm.pkg.github.com`) in addition to npmjs.com, providing an alternative installation source and tighter GitHub ecosystem integration ([#18](https://github.com/exileum/meta-mcp/issues/18))

## [3.3.0] — 2026-04-05

### Fixed
- **`threads_reply` video polling silently proceeds on timeout** — replaced the inline wait loop (which lacked a timeout error) with the shared `waitForThreadsContainer()` helper that correctly throws on timeout, preventing publication of unfinished video containers ([#21](https://github.com/exileum/meta-mcp/issues/21))
- **RateLimit fields always `undefined`** — `parseRateLimit()` now maps Meta's snake_case `x-app-usage` header fields (`call_count`, `total_cpu_time`, `total_time`) to the camelCase `RateLimit` interface, fixing silently broken rate limit data in all tool responses ([#20](https://github.com/exileum/meta-mcp/issues/20))
- **`.env` not in `.gitignore`** — added `.env*` patterns to prevent accidental secret exposure, and created `.env.example` for developer onboarding ([#22](https://github.com/exileum/meta-mcp/issues/22))

## [3.2.0] — 2026-04-04

### Fixed
- **Token exchange/refresh endpoints** — `meta_exchange_token` and `meta_refresh_token` now use the correct platform-specific endpoints and grant types ([#19](https://github.com/exileum/meta-mcp/issues/19)):
  - Instagram: `graph.instagram.com` with `ig_exchange_token` / `ig_refresh_token`
  - Threads: `graph.threads.net` with `th_exchange_token` / `th_refresh_token`
  - Previously all token operations incorrectly used the Facebook Graph API (`graph.facebook.com` with `fb_exchange_token`), which failed for both Instagram and Threads tokens
- **`meta_refresh_token` broken** — the old implementation used the wrong endpoint (`/oauth/access_token` instead of `/refresh_access_token`) and wrong grant type (`fb_exchange_token` instead of platform-specific refresh grant types), making refresh fail for all platforms

### Changed
- **`meta_exchange_token` / `meta_refresh_token`** now require a `platform` parameter (`"instagram"` or `"threads"`) to route to the correct endpoint
- **Minimum Node.js version** — raised from 18 to 22 LTS (Node 18 reached EOL in April 2025)
- **zod** — upgraded from 3.25.76 to 4.3.6
- **@modelcontextprotocol/sdk** — upgraded from 1.26.0 to 1.29.0
- **typescript** — upgraded from 5.9.3 to 6.0.2
- **@types/node** — upgraded from 22.19.11 to 25.5.2

## [3.1.0] — 2026-04-04

### Added
- **npm provenance** — packages are now published with OIDC trusted publishing for verifiable supply chain security

### Fixed
- **Instagram API base URL** — use `graph.instagram.com` for Instagram endpoints; tokens from Instagram Login flow (`IGAA...`) were rejected by `graph.facebook.com`
- **Meta platform endpoints** — separate `FB_BASE` (`graph.facebook.com`) for token exchange, debug, and webhook tools that only exist on the Facebook Graph API
- **POST request encoding** — switch from `application/json` to `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` for POST requests; optional parameters like `topic_tag` and `poll` were silently ignored by the Meta API with JSON encoding
- Deduplicate URLSearchParams building logic in `meta-client.ts`

## [3.0.0] — 2026-04-04

### Changed

## [2.0.2] — 2026-03-24

### Fixed
- **Carousel publishing** — wait for IMAGE container processing in carousel posts
